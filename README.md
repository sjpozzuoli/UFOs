# UFOs

### The purpose of this is to provide a more in-depth analysis of UFO sightings by allowing users to filter for multiple criteria at the same time. In addition to the date, user will be able to filter based on the city, state, country, and shape.

## Results

#### We were able to take a list of data and create a webpage containing that information. Furthermore, we added a filter search function, in order for the user to more easily parse the data and find specific occurrances of UFO sightings.

#### The above image shows the filter functions that are present on the webpage. The user can choose the field that they wish to search on and press enter. The result will be the webpage returning only the UFO sightings that match the search. The user can input data into one, or all, of the fields.

#### This shows the result when the user searches for all of the UFO sightings in 'NY' and hits 'Enter'. There are 4 different sightings in NY State that are contained in the data set. If there were no values within our dataset that matched the user's search, a blank page would be the end result.

## Summary

#### Overall, the webpage is user friendly and provides the user with an ability to more easily sift through the data. One slight drawback in the website design is the lack of a 'Clear' button for when the user wanted to see all of the data again. In order to display this, the user would need to manually delete the text in the fields they searched and then hit 'Enter' again.

#### There is also an opportunity to develop this website further. One thing I would recommend doing would be to gather data for a larger time frame than what we currently have. Our current data only encompasses a two week period during 2010. The second thing I would recommend is a setup for the site to automatically add new data when it is added to the data set. This way the webpage would be current with all of the UFO sightings in the world.
